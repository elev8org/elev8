      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>I’ve been fortunate to be part of different communities that gave me support, guidance, and opportunities I never thought I’d have. Those experiences shaped who I am today and showed me the power of lifting each other up.</p>
      <p>Because of all that I’ve received, I feel a responsibility to give back. I believe the best way to grow is by sharing knowledge and helping others find their path. I love seeing someone realize they can do something they didn’t think was possible. That’s why I started Elev8.</p>
      <p>Elev8 is more than just a STEM club or organization—it’s a community built on the idea that every student deserves the chance to explore, create, and learn without limits. Curiosity is welcomed, mistakes are steps forward, and growth is a shared journey.</p>
      <p>This is my way of giving back, not just by passing on knowledge, but by inspiring the next generation to be confident, innovative, and fearless. When one of us rises, we all rise. That’s the impact I want Elev8 to have.</p>
