    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve been fortunate to be part of different communities that gave me so much more than knowledge. They gave support, guidance, and opportunities I never imagined. Those experiences shaped who I am and showed the power of lifting each other up. Because of all that I’ve received, I feel a responsibility to give back. I believe the best way to grow is by sharing knowledge and helping others find their path. Seeing someone realize they can do something they didn’t think was possible is priceless. Elev8 is more than a STEM club—it’s a community where every student can explore, create, and learn without limits. Curiosity is welcomed, mistakes are steps forward, and growth is shared. This is my way of giving back, inspiring the next generation to be confident, innovative, and fearless. When one of us rises, we all rise. That’s the impact I want Elev8 to have.
