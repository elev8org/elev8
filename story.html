    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>I’ve been fortunate to be part of different communities that gave me so much more than just knowledge. They gave me support when I needed it, guidance when I was lost, and opportunities I never thought I’d have. Those experiences shaped who I am today and showed me how powerful it is when people come together to lift each other up.</p>

    <p>Because of all that I’ve received, I feel a responsibility to give back. I believe the best way to grow is by sharing what you know and helping others find their own path. I love seeing the moment when someone realizes they can do something they didn’t think was possible. That kind of moment is priceless and that’s why I started Elev8.</p>

    <p>Elev8 is more than just a STEM club or organization—it’s a community built on the idea that every student deserves the chance to explore, create, and learn without limits. It’s a place where curiosity is welcomed, mistakes are seen as steps forward, and growth is a shared journey. I want this organization to help students discover their potential and to inspire them to reach beyond what they think they can achieve.</p>

    <p>This is my way of giving back, not just by passing on knowledge, but by building something that inspires the next generation to be confident, innovative, and fearless in shaping their future. Because when one of us rises, we all rise. And that’s the kind of impact I want Elev8 to have.</p>
